# HIDIVE Subtitle Fixer
Currently, due to limitations on how HIDIVE renders subtitles, this script has to be manually triggered through the context menu. Everytime an episode changes, the page refreshes, or if you change subtitle settings, it will need to be run again. This is an unfortunate limitation, but I barely know Javascript and mainly had ChatGPT do this, and this is good enough for me. Feel free to submit a pull request to fix it if you'd like.
